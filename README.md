# Notes in Mathematics

The repository hosts collections of results from courses taken during my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo, recommended textbooks, academic papers, and many other sources.
I have been continuously building these notes since Spring 2020 and more than happy to take any critical feedback and/or constructive advice.
